# 🚀 DeliverNow – Food Delivery App Redesign (UX/UI Project)

## 📁 Project Overview

DeliverNow is a company that connects restaurants with runners to deliver takeaway food. This UX/UI project redesigns the experience across 4 key users:

1. **Customer (Client)**
2. **Restaurant Owner**
3. **Runner (Delivery Person)**
4. **Runner Manager (Fleet Manager)**

The redesign addresses major user pain points, such as inaccurate ETAs, unwanted condiments, poor route assignments, and lack of runner visibility.
